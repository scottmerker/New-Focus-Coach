                    <p>AD/HD coaching will help you better understand your learning style and identify the approaches and systems that work best for you. We begin by exploring and honoring your passions, strengths and talents. From there, we develop new skills and strategies that compensate for your areas of difficulty. Coaching is offered in person, by phone or by Skype.</p>

                    <h3><strong>How does coaching work?</strong></h3>

                    <p>Coaching is an "alliance" between client and coach. My role is to listen without judgment, heighten your self-awareness, introduce new strategies and inspire action toward the achievement of your goals. Your role is to be prepared, communicate honestly, stretch and accept challenges &mdash; all at a comfortable pace, within a safe and confidential environment.</p>

                    <h3><strong>What is the process?</strong></h3>

                    <p>First, we'll assemble a complete picture of your personal history, difficulties faced and learning style. Then we will identify measurable goals and create a custom program just for you. During weekly sessions we will review and acknowledge your accomplishments. I will provide feedback, help you tackle roadblocks and set manageable goals for the week ahead.</p>

                    <h3>Coaching Works!</h3>
                    <p>
                        A two-year ADHD coaching research study published in 2010 by the Edge Foundation linked ADHD coaching to improved executive functioning and improved success in school for students. The study showed that students receiving coaching, "…showed significant improvement in their ability to organize, direct and manage cognitive activities, emotional responses and overt behaviors. They were able to formulate goals more realistically and consistently work toward achieving them, manage their time more effectively, and stick with tasks even when they found them challenging."</p>

                        <p>Students with AD/HD are vulnerable because AD/HD impacts the portion of the brain that regulates what is known as executive functioning, including attention, planning and organization, prioritization, impulse control, memory, time management and higher-order conceptual thinking — all necessary skills for success in school and in life.</p>

                        <p>I help students with attention disorders understand how they learn best and introduces them to strategies for attacking their work and sustaining the motivation to power through it. Through coaching we'll also addresses the issues that can pull students off focus such as poor self esteem or trouble navigating difficult social challenges. Students will develop life skills to help them be happy with who they are and work within the world in a way that supports their unique needs.</p>

                        <h2>Adults</h2>
                        <h3>Awareness, Strategies, Action</h3>
                        <p>Many people who have grown up with AD/HD have been doing things the same way for so long and, while they realize a lot of their approaches aren't working, they just don't know any other way. These same adults often can only find the energy to do the things they WANT to do and then feel guilt or shame when things slip, believing they are letting themselves or others down.</p>

                        <p>Does this sound familiar? Coaching can help! Together we can determine the places in your life where you want to see change, understand what stands in your way and, most importantly, discover what will move you forward.</p>

                        <p>Adults often come to coaching because they constantly feel behind or are managing one area of their life well while another is suffering. Whether you can't get started with that project until the deadline is upon you or you just didn't remember that important meeting until you looked at your planner too late, I can help you untangle your life and uncover the systems that work best for you.</p>

                        <h2>Parents</h2>
                        <h3>Structure, Understanding, Consistency</h3>
                        <p>
                            I know from personal experience how stressful and painful as well as joyful and wonderful it can be to raise a child with an attention disorder. I am often reminded of the movie Parenthood in which Steve Martin's character compares being a parent to riding a roller coaster. For those parenting a child with unique needs, it can seem full of extra ups and downs. Parent Coaching* can help you even out the ride.</p>

                        <p>Through coaching, I will guide you in creating a home life that bolsters your AD/HD child and supports your entire family. Parents often become overwhelmed and paralyzed, feeling that every issue must be addressed at once. It's easy to get so focused on the AD/HD child's needs that you neglect yourself and other family members</p>

                        <p>While your child's behavior may at times appear otherwise, all children want to be good and please their parents. Most importantly, they all want and deserve to be loved for who they are at any given time. Through coaching, you will better understand how AD/HD impacts your particular child and learn to focus first on what matters most. Together we will identify the next steps and strategies to help you find balance and peace, and move your family forward, one step at a time.</p>

I also have presented at conferences including the Annual International Conference for Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder, as well as the Society of Learning and the Brain. I am proud to be a contributor to the book 365 Ways to Succeed with ADHD, an Amazon #1 bestseller.</p>
                    
                    <p>Before beginning my coaching practice, I spent 18 years in publishing with Time-Life Books where I helped launch the Custom Publishing division and received the Time-Life Books Award for Excellence</p>
                    
                    <p>My husband, an architect, and I live in Alexandria, Virginia. My inquisitive AD/HD son is now pursuing his passion for computer science at college. He inspires and impresses me with his tenacity and entertains me with his sense of humor and unique way of looking at life.</p>

            <p class="lead">The office is located on the corner of King and Lee Streets next to "Comfort One Shoes". Enter glass door, take stairs to third floor and turn left. On weekends and after 5:30 pm on weekdays, the front door is usually locked for security reasons so please call 703-980-0809 to let me know you have arrived.</p>
            <p>The initial strategizing session, which runs approximately one hour in length, will be scheduled in my office in Old Town Alexandria. This allows a distraction-free environment for performing evaluations and gathering the information necessary to develop a customized program.
                <ul>
                    <li>Weekly coaching appointments are held in person, by phone or by Skype, depending upon the client's age and preference.</li>
